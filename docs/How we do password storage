The way we store passwords is through salting and hashing them.

In the database we store a users salt and password hash.
When a new user is created a salt is generated for the user and stored in the database.
The users salt and password is used to create a password hash which is stored in the database.
The users plaintext password is NOT stored in the database.

When a user attempts to log in their salt is retrieved from the database.
The salt and user supplied password is then used to make a password hash.
The password hash created from the users supplied password and salt is then compared to the password hash saved in the database.
If the password hashes and usernames are identical then the login is successful

We use the java BCrypt library for generating salt and hashing the passwords
